  This page explains one of the biggest mysteries in PEPPOL: how does the 
  document exchange work and what roles does the SML (Service Metadata Locator) 
  play in it.
</p>

<p>
  To start a document exchange in PEPPOL, you need to have the following information
  before you can start submitting anything:
  <ul>
    <li>The PEPPOL Participant Identifier (PPID) of the recipient (currently this must be exchanged out-of-band but with the upcoming PEPPOL Directory there is help in sight)</li>
    <li>On which SML is the PPID registered (production SML or test SMK)</li>
    <li>The document type ID and the process ID to be used</li>
    <li>The business document to be exchanged is of course needed</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Involved PEPPOL software components are at least the following:
  <ul>
    <li>PEPPOL AccessPoint client (the sender)</li>
    <li>PEPPOL SMP client (for the lookup)</li>
  </ul>
  Additionally components like special validation services etc. may be used depending 
  on the effective setup but I wont cover them in this article. 
</p>

<p>
  Lets start at the beginning. The first thing you need to do, is to find the SMP where the
  document receiver has registered its endpoints. Therefore the PPID and the SML information are required.
