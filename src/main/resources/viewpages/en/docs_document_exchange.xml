  This article explains one of the biggest mysteries in Peppol: how does the 
  document exchange work and what roles does the SML (Service Metadata Locator) 
  play in it.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
  To start a document exchange in Peppol, you need to have the following information
  before you can start submitting anything:
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Peppol Participant Identifier</strong> (PPID) of the recipient (that can be found via the Peppol Directory)</li>
    <li>On which <strong>SML</strong> is the PPID registered (production SML or test SMK)</li>
    <li>The <strong>document type ID</strong> and the <strong>process ID</strong> to be used</li>
    <li>The <strong>business document to be exchanged</strong> is of course also needed</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>
  Lets start at the beginning. The first thing you need to do, is to find the SMP where the document receiver has registered its endpoints.
  Therefore the PPID and the SML information are required.
  <ul>
    <li>
      PPID with scheme <code>iso6523-actorid-upis</code> and value <code>9915:test</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      SML to use = DG DIGIT SMK (= the Test SML).
      The DNS zone for the SMK is <code>acc.edelivery.tech.ec.europa.eu.</code>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      First thing that happens, is that the dynamic URL is assembled.
      The algorithm that is used is the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it is two-step process.<br/>
      First step is to build the domain name via
      <code>strip-trailing(base32(sha256(lowercase(ID-VALUE))),"=") + "." + ID-SCHEME + "." + SML-ZONE-NAME</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>ID-SCHEME</code> and <code>ID-VALUE</code> are taken from the PPID
        and the <code>SML-ZONE-NAME</code> is taken from the SML used.
      That implies that each different identifier will create a different DNS name.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the identifier <code>iso6523-actorid-upis::9915:test</code> and the <code>SMK</code> the created domain is
      <code>eh5boavaktmbgzyh2a63dz4qov33fvp5nsdvqklucfraayoodw6a.iso6523-actorid-upis.acc.edelivery.tech.ec.europa.eu</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Second lookup step is to perform a DNS lookup with the created domain using the NAPTR record type.<br />
      On Linux based systems this can be e.g. done on the commandline via the <kbd>dig -t naptr</kbd>.
      For the example identifier above, the full command is
    </p>
    <p>  
      <code>dig -t naptr +short eh5boavaktmbgzyh2a63dz4qov33fvp5nsdvqklucfraayoodw6a.iso6523-actorid-upis.acc.edelivery.tech.ec.europa.eu</code>
    </p>
    <p>  
      and the output for this command is
    </p>
    <p>  
      <code>100 10 "U" "Meta:SMP" "!.*!http://test-infra.peppol.at!" .</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Pick the record that uses the type <code>U</code> and the service <code>Meta:SMP</code> and apply the 
        regular expression <code>!.*!http://test-infra.peppol.at!</code> which is de facto a complete replacement
        of the source domain so that the outcome is <code>http://test-infra.peppol.at</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Since November 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025 the result in production may use <code>http</code> or <code>https</code> scheme and may contain
        an optional path after the domain.<br/>
      From February 1<sup>st</sup>, 2026 the result in production must use <code>https</code> scheme and may contain
        an optional path after the domain.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now that we have the base URL is already the URL to the SMP and all that is left to do, is to append
        the participant identifier to the URL to get all supported document types.
    </p>    
    <p>
      For the example the URL would be 
        <code>http://test-infra.peppol.at/iso6523-actorid-upis::9915:test</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason why the participant identifier needs to be appended again is solely than an SMP can host multiple
        participants on the same server.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now that the SMP URL is known, the SMP query with the document type 
        (following the pattern <code>http://<i>smp.url</i>/<i>participantID</i>/services/<i>documentTypeID</i></code>)
        can be performed.
      The resulting, digitally signed document must be parsed so that the endpoint matching the 
        desired process ID and transport protocol can be retrieved.
      This is finally the AP URL to which the business document is to be send. 
    </p>
    <p>
      All the above mentioned steps are usually handled by the SMP client software, like my
      <a href="https://github.com/phax/peppol-commons#peppol-smp-client">OpenSource SMP client</a> or my
      <a href="https://github.com/Helger-IT/smp-query-webapp">OpenSource standalone SMP query application</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The last step is the transmission of the business document to the endpoint URL determined in the previous step.
      Additionally, components like special validation services etc. may be used depending on the effective setup but 
        they are not covered in this article.
    </p>
    <p>  
      This is the task of the AccessPoint client (or sending AP).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  And how was the SML involved in all of this? Not at all!<br />
  Only the Domain Name System (DNS) is queried upon a document exchange.<br/>
  And if the DNS ever fails, there are usually more severe issues than not being able to send documents via Peppol.
  And that is one of the smartest elements of the Peppol Network:
  No central single point of failure that can stop the document exchange for everybody.
