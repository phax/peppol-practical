This page explains how to setup an OpenPEPPOL SMP from scratch.
SMP is the abbreviation for <em>Service Metadata Publisher</em> which is the decentralized
directory service of OpenPEPPOL.
SMPs are normally only operated by Service Providers and not by endpoints.
An SMP contains information about the endpoints of receivers - the URLs where to send the main
documents to.
The information within the SMP is structured by participant ID, document type ID and process ID.  
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
  Before you can start you need to have the following information in place:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>As the very first step you need to sign the TIAs (Transport Infrastructure Agreements) with 
      <a href="http://www.peppol.eu/about_peppol/copy_of_how-to-join">OpenPEPPOL AISBL</a></li>
  <li>Afterwards you need to apply for an <em>SMP certificate</em> at OpenPEPPOL. 
      This certificate is required to run the SMP.</li>
  <li>You should have a look at the 
      <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/svn/peppol/PEPPOL_EIA/1-ICT_Architecture/1-ICT-Transport_Infrastructure/13-ICT-Models">official SMP specifications</a></li>
