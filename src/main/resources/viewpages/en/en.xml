  This page tries to give a rough overview on CEN/TC 434 an EN 16931, how it belongs together and where to find what.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> this is not an official page. This is just what I'm collecting...

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In the beginning was EN/2014/55. Article 3 starts with:
</p>
<blockquote>
  The Commission shall request that the relevant European standardisation organisation draft a European 
  standard for the semantic data model of the core elements of an electronic invoice
  (the ‘European standard on electronic invoicing’).
</blockquote>

<p>
This lead CEN to start PC 434 (Project Committee) which was later transfered to a TC (Technical Committee).
