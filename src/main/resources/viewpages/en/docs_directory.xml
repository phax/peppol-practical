  This article is meant to describe the intended use cases for the Peppol Directory.
  It describes its strengths and its weaknesses and provides some usage guidance.
</p>

<p>
  The Peppol Directory is a centralized database containing all <em>Business Card</em>.
  The directory is operated by the Operating Office and publicly available as a 
  <a href="https://test-directory.peppol.eu" target="_blank">test instance</a> and a 
  <a href="https://test-directory.peppol.eu" target="_blank">production instance</a>.
  <br/>
  It is not mandatory for Peppol Participants to be listed in the Peppol Directory, but 
    I would say it is recommended.
  This implies, that not every Peppol Participant that exists, can also be found in the Peppol Directory.
</p>

<p>
  The Directory is filled by the decentralized Peppol SMPs.
  An SMP may provide a Business Card for a Peppol Participant it manages - other SMPs cannot do that.
  The Business Card contains non-technical data of a participant and should contain a similar data
    depth as information of a <em>website imprint</em>.
  Everytime the Business Card is changed or the document types of a participant change, 
    it's the <em>SMP's responsibility</em> for informing the Directory about that, by requesting an 
    update of the Business Card of said participant.
