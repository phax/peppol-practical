<p>
This page is supposed to contain technical information for PEPPOL implementers.
This page is brought to you by Philip Helger.
I'm working for the Austrian Government and being the technical lead for 
<a href="http://www.e-rechnung.gv.at">E-RECHNUNG.GV.AT</a> the eInvoicing
solution of the Austrian government. I was a member of PEPPOL from the beginning
and am still involved in OpenPEPPOL. I also did huge parts of the 
<a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/cipaedelivery/description">CIPA e-Delivery</a>
PEPPOL reference implementation (which is based on my PEPPOL Silicone).
