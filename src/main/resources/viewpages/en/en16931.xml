  The <strong>EN 16931-1:2017</strong> was published on October 17<sup>th</sup> 2017 in the OJ.
  That means that since <strong>April 18<sup>th</sup> 2019</strong> most public procuring entities must be able
  to accept e-Invoices complying to the UBL and CII syntax requirements defined in <strong>CEN/TS 16931-3-2</strong>
  and <strong>CEN/TS 16931-3-3</strong>!

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In the beginning was directive 2014/55/EU. Article 3 starts with:
</p>
<blockquote>
  The Commission shall request that the relevant European standardisation organisation draft a European 
  standard for the semantic data model of the core elements of an electronic invoice
  (the ‘European standard on electronic invoicing’).
</blockquote>

<p>
This lead CEN to start PC 434 (Project Committee) which was later transfered to a TC (Technical Committee) &rarr; <code>CEN/TC 434</code>.
</p>

<a name="struct"></a>
<h2>Structure of work</h2>

<h2>Working with the EN 16931</h2>

<p>
  From a practical point of view this norm means, that all public entities performing public procurement cannot reject
  electronic invoices from April 18<sup>th</sup> 2019 if they are retrieved in UBL or CII formats complying to the norm.
  Certain receivers have an additional 12 month to comply to the requirements, ending up on April 18<sup>th</sup> 2020.
</p>

<p>
  Because life would be too easy if EN 16931 was a "one size fits all" solution, there are already a lot of 
  so called CIUSs developed. A CIUS is an additional specification on top of <strong>EN 16931-1:2017</strong> that
  narrows certain fields for certain use cases.
  The methodology how a CIUS is defined, can be found in <strong>CEN/TR 16931-5:2017</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  An unofficial self-declaration based list of CIUSs is provided by
  <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EINVCOMMUNITY/Community-driven+Registry+of+CIUS+%28Core+Invoice+Usage+Specifications%29+and+Extensions">CEF</a>.
  One upcoming task of CEN/TC 434 is to establish an official registry of CIUSs.
</p>
<p>
  Another project in CEN/TC 434 tries to setup a more elaborate registry for CIUS, Extension and Code list.
  The current effort can be seen at <a href="https://www.helger.com/registry434/">https://www.helger.com/registry434/</a>
  but please bare in mind, that this is work in progress. Details will follow.
</p>

<a name="get"></a>
<h3>How to get the norm?</h3>
<p>
  You should be able to download the standard (at least parts 1 and 2) for free from your
  <a href="https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=CENWEB:5">local standardization body</a>.
  E.g. at Austrian Standards (ASI) 
  <a href="https://shop.austrian-standards.at/action/de/public/details/617473/OENORM_EN_16931-1_2017_11_01">ÖNORM EN 16931-1: 2017 11 01</a>
  and
  <a href="https://shop.austrian-standards.at/action/de/public/details/617015/ONR_CEN_TS_16931-2_2017_10_15">ONR CEN/TS 16931-2: 2017 10 15</a>
  can be downloaded free of charge, whereas parts 3, 4, 5 and 6 are payable documents. 
</p>
<p>
  If you are impatient and would ask me what documents to buy I would suggest the following ones:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>EN 16931-1:2017</strong></li>
  <li><strong>CEN/TS 16931-3-1:2017</strong></li>
  <li>One or more of <strong>CEN/TS 16931-3-2:2017</strong>, <strong>CEN/TS 16931-3-2:2017</strong> or <strong>CEN/TS 16931-3-3:2017</strong> - depending on what you want to implement</li>
  <li><strong>CEN/TR 16931-5:2017</strong></li>
</ul>

<a name="tec"></a>
<h3>Technical requirements</h3>

<p>
  Mostly it is about validating, if a UBL or CII documents fulfills all the requirements from the norm.
  Therefore the following steps need to be performed:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Validate the e-Invoice against the XML Schema of UBL 2.1 or CII D16B - depending on the namespace URI of the XML root element</li>
  <li>
    Apply the Schematron rules for the correct syntax.
    Schematrons are available from <a href="https://github.com/ConnectingEurope/eInvoicing-EN16931">GitHub</a>. 
    Up to and including v1.2.3 the validation artefacts were licensed under the Apache 2 license, since version 1.3.0 they are licensed under the EUPL 1.2.
    
    A fully working open source validation engine is available at <a href="https://github.com/phax/ph-bdve/">https://github.com/phax/ph-bdve/</a> 
    licensed under the business friendly Apache 2 license.
    It supports the official EN 16931 validation artefacts for UBL, CII and XML EDIFACT invoices besides a lot of different standards.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you need to follow a certain CIUS, apply the Schematrons of the CIUS in the correct order as well.
    As there are currently no published CIUSs, there is also no predefined tool support for this.
  </li>
</ol>
