This page explains how to setup an OpenPEPPOL SMP from scratch.
SMP is the abbreviation for <em>Service Metadata Publisher</em> which is the decentralized
directory service of OpenPEPPOL.
SMPs are normally only operated by Service Providers and not be endpoints.
An SMP contains information about the endpoints of receivers - the URLs where to send the main
documents to.
The information within the SMP is structured by participant ID, document type ID and process ID.
