<p>
  This page explains what needs to be done to migrate the SML from the old 
  BRZ operated domain to the new DG DIGIT operated domain.
  This document tries to explain the requirements in a general manner but will focus on the 
  <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/cipaedelivery/description">CIPA e-Delivery</a>
  implementation for the technical details. 
</p>

<p>
 The changes in the SML affect the following components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>SMP server - the server/backend component of the SMP</li>
  <li>SMP client - the client/requesting component of the SMP</li>
  <li>AP server - the receiving component of the Access Point (because SMP client usage)</li>
  <li>AP client - the sending component of the Access Point (because SMP client usage)</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Note: inside this document the term <em>SML</em> represents the production SML and the term
  <em>SMK</em> represents the publically available test version of the SML which should not be
  used in production.
</div>

<h2>Changed domain names</h2>

<p>The following table shows all changed domain names at a glance.</p>

<table class="table">

      <th>Operator</th>
      <th>SML domain name</th>
      <th>SMK domain name</th>

<h2>Changes for CIPA e-Delivery</h2>

<p>
  This section outlines the necessary changes to be performed in the different CIPA components.
  Please make sure that you are using the latest CIPA <strong>version 2.2.2</strong> which can be obtained
  either as the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/svn/cipaedelivery/tags/2.2.2/">source code</a>
  or in <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/">binary form</a>.
</p>

<h3>cipa-smp-full-webapp &amp; cipa-smp-readonly-webapp</h3>

<p>
  This is the SMP server component that manages all endpoints and has a connection to the SML
  for creating, updating and deleting entries in the DNS system.
  The difference between the two applications is only that <em>cipa-smp-full-webapp</em>
  supports reading and writing REST API, whereas <em>cipa-smp-readonly-webapp</em>
  supports only the reading REST API.
  This differentiation exists because the SMP specification only specifies the reading access.
