<p>
  This page explains what needs to be done to migrate the SML from the old 
  BRZ operated domain to the new DG DIGIT operated domain.
  This document tries to explain the requirements in a general manner but will focus on the 
  <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/cipaedelivery/description">CIPA e-Delivery</a>
  implementation for the technical details. 
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Note: inside this document the term <em>SML</em> represents the production SML and the term
  <em>SMK</em> represents the publically available test version of the SML which should not be
  used in production.
