<h3>2014-11-13 - <em>as2-peppol-server</em> released</h3>

<p>
  Based on my previous projects <a href="https://github.com/phax/as2-lib">as2-lib</a>, 
  <a href="https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-servlet">as2-peppol-servlet</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/phax/ph-ubl">ph-ubl</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/phax/peppol-sbdh">peppol-sbdh</a> I created a minimal
  PEPPOL AS2 server for receiving PEPPOL AS2 messages. The project 
  <strong><a href="https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-server">as2-peppol-server</a></strong>
  is located on GitHub and available as OSS under the Apache 2.0 license.

<h3>2014-11-05 - CIPA 2.2.3 released</h3>

<p>
  CIPA 2.2.3 is a minor update that basically extends the SMP client and the SML
  client library functionality. Additionally the class <code>ConfiguredDNSMapper</code>
  got deprecated because I assume it is of no further need as the original author (BRZ)
  no longer needs it (for quite some time now).

<h3>2014-10-20 - SSL 3.0 vulnerability - POODLE</h3>

<p>
  Because of the SSL 3.0 vulnerability called POODLE 
  (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE</a>) 
  certain PEPPOL APs may disable SSL 3.0 on their systems.
</p>
<p>
  For the Oracle Java Runtime the code of the <code>AccessPointClient</code> is fine. 
  So when you are using the Oracle JDK no further actions need to be taken.
  But when using the <strong>IBM Java Runtime</strong> please make sure that you 
  set the constant <code>SSL_PROTOCOL</code> in class <code>AccessPointClient</code> 
  from <code>SSL</code> to <code>TLS</code>.
</p>

<p>
  A new release of the <code>cipa-start-client</code> was build, which fixes this problem for IBM JDKs. 
  The version number of the fix release is <strong>2.2.2-1</strong> and it can be found in the 
  Joinup Nexus (binary format - 
  <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/eu/europa/ec/cipa/cipa-start-client/2.2.2-1/">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/eu/europa/ec/cipa/cipa-start-client/2.2.2-1/</a>) 
  and in the CIPA SVN (sources - 
  <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/svn/cipaedelivery/tags/2.2.2-1">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/svn/cipaedelivery/tags/2.2.2-1</a>).
