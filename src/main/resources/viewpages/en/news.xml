    <h3>2017-06-01 - PP update</h3>
    
    <p>
      Todays PEPPOL practical update is mainly for improved Simplerinvoicing validation.
      The version 1.1 was restored and 1.2 validation was fixed.
    </p>

    <h3>2017-05-31 - CIPA SMP 3.0 announcement</h3>
    
    <p>
      As announced today the CIPA SMP 3.0 which will be released soon
      will only comply to the OASIS SMP specification but <strong>NOT</strong>
      to the PEPPOL SMP specification.
      So from a PEPPOL perspective there's currently no need to plan an update.
      But that may of course trigger a quicker transition of PEPPOL from the
      PEPPOL SMP specification to the OASIS SMP specification... another TICC todo. 
    </p>

    <h3>2017-05-22 - Participant information tool improved</h3>
    
    <p>
      The participant information tool now has an "Auto-detect SML" feature and also
      tries to print a few information even if a request fails. 
    </p>

    <h3>2017-05-19 - TICC Codelist Team (TCT) founded</h3>
    
    <p>
      A new PEPPOL TICC team was founded to take care of the "PEPPOL Policy for the use of identifiers"
      as well the basic codelists for transmission (identifier issuing agencies, document type, processes
      and transport protocols).
      The new team is lead by me and if you want to actively participate, please drop me a note.
      The initial telephone conference is planned for June 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup>.
    </p>

   <h3>2017-05-17 - Spring release Update</h3>
    
    <p>
      Because some changes from RC1 to final were missing, the artefacts were re-released.
      PEPPOL Practical was using the correct artefacts from the beginning!

      The first day started with an introduction section for newcomers and continued with
        a lot of presentation on what's going on.
      The second day had more of a workshop character with interactive sessions and that
        was highly appreciated by the attendees.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2017-04-07 - New PEPPOL website online</h3>

      The SMK release was updated to version 3.0.1 which fixes most of the mentioned
      problems.

    <p>
      My <a href="https://github.com/phax/peppol-smp-server">SMP Server</a> 4.0.2 was 
      released. It fixes the compatibility problems introduced by the SMK 3.0.0 release.
      If you are only using the SML client library, please make sure to use at least
      version 4.3.1.

    <h3>2015-11-03</h3>
    
    <p>
      Here is a list of issues I've identified with the new SMK 3.0.0:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The handling of participant IDs is now case-sensitive (this is not compliant with the BusDox spec)</li>
      <li>The name of the list DNS servlet changed from "listdns" to "listDNS"</li>
      <li>The "delete participant" API now requires a valid SMP-ID to be provided (this is incompatible with existing SML client solutions) - the respective changes are contained in my peppol-sml-client as of version 4.3.1</li>
      <li>The SMK now accepts any participant identifier schemes that are incompatible to the BusDox specs</li>
    </ul>

      If you are still using PEPPOL LIME there is good news for you. I grabbed the deprecated CIPA
      component and am providing a LIME server and client based on AS2. Have a look at it at

    <h3>2015-04-02 - New PEPPOL SMP server implementation available</h3>
    
    <p>
      Based on the CIPA SMP server 2.2.3 I decided to fork my own clone of a PEPPOL
      SMP. It is available in 2 different versions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/phax/peppol-smp-server">peppol-smp-server</a>
        - an SMP server that uses a relational database (like MySQL) as the backend.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/phax/peppol-smp-server-lightweight">peppol-smp-server-lightweight</a>
        - an SMP server that uses a file-based backend and keeps all information in main memory for
        performance reasons. Additionally it includes a small management UI. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both SMP servers use shared components also available on GitHub:
      <a href="https://github.com/phax/peppol-commons">peppol-commons</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/phax/peppol-smp-client">peppol-smp-client</a> and

    <h3>2014-11-13 - <em>as2-peppol-server</em> released</h3>
    
    <p>
      Based on my previous projects <a href="https://github.com/phax/as2-lib">as2-lib</a>, 
      <a href="https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-servlet">as2-peppol-servlet</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/phax/ph-ubl">ph-ubl</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/phax/peppol-sbdh">peppol-sbdh</a> I created a minimal
      PEPPOL AS2 server for receiving PEPPOL AS2 messages. The project 
      <strong><a href="https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-server">as2-peppol-server</a></strong>
      is located on GitHub and available as OSS under the Apache 2.0 license.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2014-11-05 - CIPA 2.2.3 released</h3>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/release/cipa-e-delivery/223">CIPA 2.2.3</a> is a minor update that basically extends the SMP client and the SML
      client library functionality. Additionally the class <code>ConfiguredDNSMapper</code>
      got deprecated because I assume it is of no further need as the original author (BRZ)
      no longer needs it (for quite some time now).
    </p>
    
    <h3>2014-10-20 - SSL 3.0 vulnerability - POODLE</h3>
    
    <p>
      Because of the SSL 3.0 vulnerability called POODLE 
      (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE</a>) 
      certain PEPPOL APs may disable SSL 3.0 on their systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Oracle Java Runtime the code of the <code>AccessPointClient</code> is fine. 
      So when you are using the Oracle JDK no further actions need to be taken.
      But when using the <strong>IBM Java Runtime</strong> please make sure that you 
      set the constant <code>SSL_PROTOCOL</code> in class <code>AccessPointClient</code> 
      from <code>SSL</code> to <code>TLS</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A new release of the <code>cipa-start-client</code> was build, which fixes this problem for IBM JDKs. 
      The version number of the fix release is <strong>2.2.2-1</strong> and it can be found in the 
      Joinup Nexus (binary format - 
      <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/eu/europa/ec/cipa/cipa-start-client/2.2.2-1/">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/eu/europa/ec/cipa/cipa-start-client/2.2.2-1/</a>) 
      and in the CIPA SVN (sources - 
      <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/svn/cipaedelivery/tags/2.2.2-1">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/svn/cipaedelivery/tags/2.2.2-1</a>).
